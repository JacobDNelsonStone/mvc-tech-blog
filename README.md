# MVC Tech Blog

This assignment we were tasked with creating a simple tech blog site, with user log in and sign up functionality. You can also comment, and create posts with your account. We created this web app using the Model-View-Controller file structure. This assignment has been incredibly helpful in understanding and practicing the MVC file structure. We also used handlebars.js to render our webpage content. These were also really fun to use for me!
